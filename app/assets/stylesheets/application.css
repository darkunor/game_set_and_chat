 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.

 *= require_self
 *Had to swap require_self with require_tree so changes in the application CSS will overide boostrap done in order to revert to restore the text on the topic show page to normal text!
